# Kubernetes "kubectl" Provider 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gavinbunney/terraform-provider-kubectl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gavinbunney/terraform-provider-kubectl)

This is a fork (of a fork!) of the original provider provided by [nabancard and lawrecncegripper](https://github.com/nabancard/terraform-provider-kubernetes-yaml).

This fork adds :
1. Support for in-place updates of kubernetes resources
2. Data resource to iterate over directories of manifests

## Using the provider

Download a binary for your system from the release page and remove the `-os-arch` details so you're left with `terraform-provider-kubectl`.
Use `chmod +x` to make it executable and then either place it at the root of your Terraform folder or in the Terraform plugin folder on your system. 

### Quick Start

```hcl
provider "kubectl" {
  host                   = var.eks_cluster_endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(var.eks_cluster_ca)
  token                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.main.token
  load_config_file       = false
}

resource "kubectl_manifest" "test" {
    yaml_body = <<YAML
apiVersion: couchbase.com/v1
kind: CouchbaseCluster
metadata:
  name: name-here-cluster
spec:
  baseImage: name-here-image
  version: name-here-image-version
  authSecret: name-here-operator-secret-name
  exposeAdminConsole: true
  adminConsoleServices:

    indexStorageSetting: memory_optimized

}
```

## Development Guide

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.12+ is *required*).
You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

### Building The Provider

```sh
$ go get github.com/gavinbunney/terraform-provider-kubectl
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/gavinbunney/terraform-provider-kubectl
$ make build
```

### Testing

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

The provide uses MiniKube to run integration tests. These tests look for any `*.tf` files in the `_examples` folder and run an `plan`, `apply`, `refresh` and `plan` loop over each file. 

Inside each file the string `name-here` is replaced with a unique name during test execution. This is a simple string replace before the TF is applied to ensure that tests don't fail due to naming clashes. 

Each scenario can be placed in a folder, to help others navigate and use the examples, and added to the [README.MD](./_examples/README.MD). 

> Note: The test infrastructure doesn't support multi-file TF configurations so ensure your test scenario is in a single file. 

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
